# DAO 2.0
I've been around blockchain on and off for some time now, but now I'm finally starting to really internalize how incredibly important this technology can be for bringing out the best in humanity. Blockchain represents trust and decentralized ownership. I believe these two concepts represent a way to bring out the best in humanity. 

Part of why modern society seems so fucked up is because organizational systems have fallen hopelessly behind human capabilities. Dishonest people (like those who run many of the most influential companies in the world) can take advantage of us and harm our minds and bodies because we don't have any recourse to keep them in check. 

I believe blockchain can be instrumental in implementing uncheatable systems that can enforce checks and balances to incentivize honesty, build a higher-trust society, and allow us as a species to achieve our highest potential. 

## Install directions
```bash
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

## Thought process so far
I chose Solidity 0.8.20 because if it's good enough for OpenZeppelin, it's good enough for me.

## Current contract limitations
### DAO.sol
* Users are not required to stake their tokens to vote
* The contract is not upgradeable right now
